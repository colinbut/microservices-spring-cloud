# Microservices Spring Cloud

"Microservices example demo - using Spring Cloud Project"

This is another of my microservices example demo project. This is quite similar to my other microservice example project: https://github.com/colinbut/microservices-online-webshop. 

But the difference with this one is that this one uses Spring Cloud entirely to build the microservices along with of course the Netflix OSS projects. Whereas, the other example showcases a generic Microservices example system application where each 'micro' service is built differently - Polygot.
